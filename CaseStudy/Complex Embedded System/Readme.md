A Smart Watch is an embedded system which offers extra functionality and connectivity on top of the features. To perform the operation it contains the followings blocks

Microcontroller Unit: The smart match includes a controller for communicating with the sensors and other peripheral devices. It basically controller all the operations by sending and receiving the signals from sensors and actuator. It also helps in providing information through the led and display unit.

Sensors: All the sensors are interfaced with the microcontroller for the transmission of the information. The temperature sensors measure body temperature 24/7 and also keeps informing about temperature on time. Pulse sensor monitor flow of blood from the heart.

Accelerometer: The accelerometer helps to track forward and backward movement of the body, position, rate of speed change and monitors sleep and wakeup time etc.

Bluetooth: A bluetooth is used to connect to mobile or any other electronic devices. It is interfaced with the controller via URAT protocol to transmit and receive the signals.

Memory Unit: The smart watch also contains the memory to store the information from the sensors or any other data.

LED & Display: The display unit consists on LCD or OLED for better picture quality and viewing angles or informaion and they also provide better battery life. The LED is used to indicated the changes in the sensors value, low battery indication etc.
